ScaN (Security and Networking) Lab is at the 
[University of California, Los Angeles](https://www.ee.ucla.edu/) 
in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department.

Our research takes a data-driven approach to understanding the Internet’s performance and security. We build data collection systems that rigorously account for the Internet’s complexities to reveal in near-real time previously-unseen critical operational challenges and threats.

## Joining the Lab
If you are interested in taking a class to learn more about our lab's research area, check out these courses: [ECE239AS: Computer Network Measurement and Security](https://lizizhikevich.github.io/ECE239AS-NetSec). Currently our lab is mostly full, but feel free to email [Liz](mailto:lizhikev@ucla.edu) or [Manda](mailto:mandat@ucla.edu) to learn about when we might have future openings.
