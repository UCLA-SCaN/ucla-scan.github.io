SCaN (Security and Networking) is a research lab at the 
[University of California, Los Angeles](https://www.ee.ucla.edu/) 
in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department.

Our research takes a data-driven approach to understanding the Internet’s performance and security. We build data collection systems that rigorously account for the Internet’s complexities to reveal in near-real time previously-unseen critical operational challenges and threats.

## Joining the Lab
We are looking for new students to join the lab! If you are interested getting involved, please reach out to [Liz](mailto:lizhikev@ucla.edu) or [Manda](mailto:mandat@ucla.edu).
